# Roses of Rosebush
#### Puzzle id = 001
Once upon a time there was a boy called L, who lived in the Magical Puzzle Forest with his two best friends, M and D.

One day L decided to go out for a stroll in the garden, and hitherto skipped down the garden path, winding through the roses. I wonder how many roses are in flower in our garden at the moment, he thought to himself.

Being that certain special kind of magical adventurer, L decided to find out by using an image analyser he had been playing with. The analyser counts specified objects in images, and he had trained them to recognise different types of flowers (using D's extensive library of gardening books for training).

So, skipping merrily around the garden, L snapped pictures of the rose bushes as he passed and ran them through the analyser on his laptop. In no time the software had given a list of the number of flowers in each picture. So far so good, but it is just a list of numbers ([your task input](./data.json)) - what L wanted was the total number of roses in the garden.

Using the `answer` function in `./answer.ts`, return the total number of roses in the garden using [the list](./data.json) returned by the analyser.

After all, this is the Magical Puzzle Forest, is it not?

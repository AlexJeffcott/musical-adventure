# Typescript tasks for learning

## Motivation

I wanted to put together a smooth, 'production ready' environment which people could use to learn and practice Typescript / Javascript without the setup pain.

## Get started

The only real prerequisite is [node >14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone the repo and create a new branch with you handle, make a tiny change, commit and push. For example, for me it would be:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AlexJeffcott/musical-adventure.git
cd musical-adventure
git checkout -b ajt
npm i

```
